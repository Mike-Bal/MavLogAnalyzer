MavLogAnalyzer needs some external code to work properly:

 1. Clone the MAVLink sources from https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink
 2. Change into the new subdirectory "mavlink" and run mavgenerate.py
    to generate the appropriate sources. You have to select an XML file
    suitable for your MAV's autopilot from "message_definitions". As
    language select "C", and as output directory make a subfolder "gen"
    within the mavlink folder.
 3. Check the folder "gen" for contents (should not be empty)
 4. We are done here.
